Cassandra monitoring project

This project aims to provide a management interface to Cassandra and also delve
deep inside the JMX infrastructure to provide performance metrics.

Future-bound, it is envisioned that the system will allow deep configuration
of Apache Cassandra similar to say MSSQL Enterprise Manager

Based around a daemon (per node) and a tornado/web.py (client+server)
idea.

Contributors welcome. Brand new pre-alpha project.
