Cassandra monitoring project

This project aims to provide a management interface to Cassandra and also delve
deep inside the JMX infrastructure to provide real-time health monitoring of
the Cassandra/JVM internals.  It is also envisioned that there will be a
benchmarking system using statistical theories for schema/data optimisation.

Future-bound, it is envisioned that the system will allow deep configuration
of Apache Cassandra similar to say MS-SQL server management studio: -

VISUAL: (inspiration) http://is.gd/sVVXDR

It will be based around a daemon (per node) and a tornado/web.py (client+server)
idea.

Contributors welcome. Brand new pre-alpha project.
