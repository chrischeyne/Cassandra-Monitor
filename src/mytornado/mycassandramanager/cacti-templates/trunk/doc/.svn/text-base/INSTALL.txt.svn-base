  Cacti

    Cacti requires
    xml templates with the graph settings, and the compiled
    cassandra-cacti-m6.jar which has the Java "Fetch code".

    Checkout the entire project and build it. This requires JAVAC, SVN and ANT.

    cd /tmp
    svn co http://www.jointhegrid.com/svn/cassandra-cacti-m6/trunk/ cassandra-cacti-m6
    cd cassandra-cacti-m6
    ant jar

    cp dist/cassandra-cacti-m6 <cacti_home>/scripts/

Importing the Graph Templates into Cacti

  Using your cacti web interface, go to the 'Import Template' section:
	  Inside trunk/cacti_templates you will find and XML file. Import this file.

    Yes! We actually support multiple verions, the entire project is branched
    internally. So one monitoring server can graph multiple clusters running
    different major versions of Hadoop!

Usage

  Each graph takes several parameters.
  1 host
  2 port
  3 user
  4 pass
  5 keyspace (ks)
  6 columnfamily (cf)

NRPE
  While these templates can work by doing JMX directly this method has been found to be problems on some networks. Now the cacti templates
  call NRPE which makes the JMX calls. 

Using JWalker

  JWalker is a command line JMX walk tool. You can use it like you would use jconsole
  to dump the properties of JMX. In particular your need this to determing the
  name of DataNode objects.

  sh JWalker.sh service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://10.0.1.2:10001/jmxrmi \

  If you want to show off a graph from cassandra-cacti-m6, you can sanitize hostnames
  (or not) and send it to me along with a comment.
  I will be sure to add it to the site!
